# pick-a-browser

`pick-a-browser` is a browser selector for Windows.
It registers as a browser and when launched it runs a configurable rule set to determine the real browser to launch.
If no rule matches then it prompts for the browser to launch from a configured list of browsers/profiles.

`pick-a-browser` was born after happily using (and contributing to) [BrowserPicker](https://github.com/mortenn/BrowserPicker).
After a number of reinstallations of the operating system, I wanted an automatic way to save my browser and rules configuration.
As a result, I created `pick-a-browser` as a way to address this (and to tweak behaviour in ways that suit my usage patterns slightly better).
